-- MODULE DECLARATION ----------------------------------------------------------

-- MODULE OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR ---------------------------------------------------

Stateful.__index = Stateful

-- Create a new [Stateful] class instance.
function Stateful.new()
  local self = setmetatable({}, Stateful)
  return self
end

-- MODULE FUNCTIONS ------------------------------------------------------------

-- Initialized the instance, binding the passed states table and initializing
-- each state in sequence. The states can be indexed both by a numeric index
-- or table key. Along with the states list, we are passing also a table to
-- be used as a shared environment" (it will be propagated to the states, as
-- well).

  self.environment = environment
  
  for key, state in pairs(states) do
    state:initialize(self.environment)
    self.states[key] = state
  end
end

-- Leave the current state, if any, and switch to the new one (whose index/key
-- match the formal argument [key]).
function Stateful:switch_to(key)
  -- Check if the requested state exists. If not, bail out.
  local state = self.states[key]

  end

-- Handles the input from the user.
function Stateful:input(keys)
  -- Current state not defined, bail out.
  if not self.current then
    return
  end
  self.current:input(keys)
end

-- Update the current state, if any. Also handle the state-switch mechanism.
function Stateful:update(dt)
  -- Current state not defined, bail out.
  if not self.current then
    return
  end
  -- Update the current state. The result value is the key of the new state to
  -- be activated, or [nil] to continue with the current one.
  local key = self.current:update(dt)
  if key then
    self:switch_to(key)
  end

-- Draw the current state, if any.
